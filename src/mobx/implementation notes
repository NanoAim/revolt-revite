split settings per account(?)
multiple accounts need to be supported

redux -> mobx migration (wipe existing redux data post-migration)

> look into talking with other tabs to detect multiple instances
> (also use this to tell the user to close all tabs before updating)

write new settings data structures for server-side
---- (deprecate existing API and replace with new endpoints?)
alternatively: keep using current system and eventually migrate
or: handle both incoming types of data and keep newer version (v1_prefix)
need to document these data structures

provide state globally? perform all authentication from inside mobx
mobx parent holds client information and prepares us for first render

reasoning for global:

-   we can't and won't have more than one of the application running in a single tab
-   interactions become simpler
-   all accounts will be managed from one place anyways

things such as unreads can pass through this data store providing a host of
information, such as whether there are any alerts on channels, etc
